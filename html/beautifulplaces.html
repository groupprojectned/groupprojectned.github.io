						<p>The key Bioderversity (KBAs) Standard is a major breakthrough for global biodiversity conservation. it has brought together 12 of the largest conservation NGOs worldwide to archive a common goal of identifying the most impotant sites for conserving biodiversity globally at a time when it is rapidly</p>
						<p>Biodiversity, simply put, is the diversity of all living organisms in the terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. The KBA standard sets out global criteria for the identification of KBAs. 'This is the first time the conservation community has come together to develop a set of agreed-upon, standardised criteria to identify sites of global important for biodiversity.' says Daniel Marnewick, the KBA community Africa Representative and the manager of the important Bird and Biodiversity Area Programme at Birdlife South Africa </p>
						<p><i>Establishing a single measurable for all texa and ecosystems to identify the most important sites naturally required lengthy</i></p>
						<p>WWF, The International Union for Conservation of Nature, Birdlife International and Consevarvation International were among the NGOs that signed the KBA agreement in September 2016 at the IUCN World Conservation Congress. </p>
						<p>Within the next two months Marnwick, in partnership with the South African National Biodiversity Institute and the newly established KBA National Coordination Group, will work with a leading conversation planner to start the considerable work of reassessing and proposing South Africa's comprehensive list of KBAs to the KBA Secretariat in Cambridge, UK. 'We will be one of the first countries worldwide to do a complete national assessment of our KBAs,' says Marnwick. The WWF Nedbank Green Trust is funding Marnwick's national work and regional support role in Africa, and the reassessment is cofunded by SANBI</p>
						<p>The mountain fynbos in the Western Cape is as good example of where we expect to identify many KBAs, as it has so many threatened and endemic speciaes. Another KBA is the few remaining patches of mistbelt grasslands in KZN, which have been severaly fragmented. These are key grasslands and form part of South Africa's strategic water source areas, holding a number of threatened species such as the swallow and oribi</p>
						<p>KBAs are intended to be identified and proposed from the bottom up by the local experts, and driven by the National Coordination Groups consisting  of a range of scientists, conservation and spatial planning experts, leading conservation NGOs and government departments and institutes. In South Africa government departments include the Department of Environmental Affairs  and SANBI</p>
						<p>In many other South African countries advanced conservation and spatial planning programmes do not exist, and so areas that could qualify as KBAs have not been identified 'South Africa has assummed a regional responsibility to support the Boidiversity assessment process on African countries, and we are currently working with four African countries to identify red-lited species and ecosystems, which they can then use to identify their KBAs part of the objectives is also to work with the local NGOs and experts in these countries to develop the local human capacity and kills to identify and manage KBAs.'</p>
						<p>How well we safeguard our KBAs will also be the measure by which the rest of the wolrd assesses our success in conserving our biodiversity, aas will be the case for other countries that are signatories to the Convention on Biological Diversity.' says Marnwick.' A robust network of KBAs gives is fraction to lobby for the protection of these sites on a global scale, and to be able to apply for support from global funders who request that initiatives they support subscribe to the KBA standard. Such funders include the global Environmental Facility and the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund.'</p>
						<p>'KBAs are a global indicator for where counties should place protected areas and conservation areas. If countries con begin protecting the most important biodiversity areas globally, this process has the ability to start tipping the biodiversity scales away from decline'</p>

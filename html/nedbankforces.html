						<p>Monday, 9 July 2018 – In a continued drive to encourage and build a better society Nedbank confirmed its partnership as a major partner with international advocacy organisation Global Citizen to bring the concert-style Global Citizen Festival to the African continent for the first time. Aptly named Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 in celebration of the centenary year of Nelson Mandela, it will be held at Soccer City, Johannesburg, on 2 December 2018.</p>
						<p>Since the first Global Citizen Festival in New York in 2012, Global Citizen has grown into one of the largest activist platforms for people around the world to call on world leaders to honour their responsibilities in achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and ending extreme poverty by 2030.</p>
						<p>Headlined by Beyoncé and JAY-Z, Cassper Nyovest, D’banj, Ed Sheeran, Eddie Vedder, Femi Kuti, Pharrel Williams and Chris Martin, Sho Madjozi, Tiwa Savage, Usher and Wizkid this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see massive international acts coming to South Africa to honour Nelson Mandela’s legacy. In another first for South Africa, the majority of tickets will be available ‘free’; citizens can earn their tickets to the A-list event by taking action on social media platforms to encourage a better society.</p>
						<p>‘At Nedbank we recognise that we have a responsibility to use our financial expertise for the good of our clients and greater society to bring about sustainable change,’ says Khensani Nobanda, Group Executive for Nedbank Group Marketing and Corporate Affairs. We understand that we cannot do it alone and now, more than ever, we need to empower all citizens to take action in innovative and impactful ways to tackle our continent’s biggest challenges and build a better and more equitable society,’ added Nobanda.</p>
						<p>To gain free entry to the Global Citizen Festival all you need to do is register by downloading the Global Citizen app or on www.globalcitizen.org and start taking action from 21 August on issues of health and nutrition, education, gender equality, water and sanitation, and the criminalisation of poverty.</p>
						<p>Each action you take not only earns you points, but will also help drive the change required to address some of the world’s greatest challenges. Once you earn enough points, you will be entered in a draw. If you win, you will receive two tickets to the festival, along with the satisfaction of knowing that you have made a difference.</p>
						<p>‘Nedbank has also been a long-term supporter of Nelson Mandela’s legacy through the Nedbank Children's Affinity, which gives our clients the opportunity to support the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund at no cost to them. Since the fund’s inception in 2005 more than R82 million has been donated to support underprivileged, vulnerable and orphaned children in Southern Africa. The Global Citizen Festival aligns with these commitments in a way that honours Tata Madiba and supports poverty alleviation – a cause that was so close to his heart,’ Nobanda explains.</p>
						<p>Over the years millions of people around the world have taken action to solve the world's biggest challenges through the Global Citizen platform. To date the organisation has raised over US $35 billion in financial commitments from governments and the private sector to solve global issues and influence the lives of one billion people.</p>
						<p>This year the Mandela 100 campaign seeks to mobilise a further US $1 billion in new commitments for the world’s poorest, with US $500 million set aside to impact the lives of 20 million women and girls worldwide.</p>

						<p>The threat to our rhinos from illegal wildlife trafficking takes centre stage in the media. But working tirelessly in the background are conservationists and scientists, including those in the WWF Black Rhino Range Expansion project (BRREP).</p>
						<p>Established in 2003 by veterinarian and project leader Dr Jacques Flamand, BRREP has over the past 15 years been focusing on best-practice management to increase the population growth of black rhinos, of which there are only 2 000 left in South Africa and which are listed as critically endangered.</p>
						<p>‘We are increasing black rhino population numbers by removing excess individuals from provincial parks in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape and translocating them to new areas,’ explains BRREP project coordinator Ursina Rusch, who has a master’s in zoology and has worked with BRREP for several years.</p>
						<p>Since 2004, 11 black rhino populations have been established in KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and Limpopo through BRREP, with seven of the participating community and private reserves being in KwaZulu-Natal. The project aims to increase the area of land available for black rhino consistently with a view to increasing animal numbers.</p>
						<p>BRREP is funded by WWF Netherlands and is recognised as one of WWF’s most successful species conservation projects, with the current DNA genetic management plan and rhino management handbook being funded by Nedbank through its Green Affinity. This vital new project is being led by Ursina Rusch.</p>
						<p>To maintain genetic diversity and prevent inbreeding from impacting rhino recovery a genetic management plan will be put in place for all 11 sites based on the outcome of the genetic analyses. ‘We need to take genetic samples from the rhinos in order to make informed management decisions about when to swap out dominant males or their offspring, and when new genetics need to be brought in,’ Rusch explains. Male and female black rhinos sexually mature at six or seven years old and can live up to 35 years.</p>
						<p>DNA samples are taken at all BRREP sites whenever black rhinos are immobilised for medical checks, horn removals or translocations. The samples are then submitted to RhODIS – the national rhino DNA indexing system (http://rhodis.co.za/) for black and white rhino that was initiated by the Veterinary Genetics Lab at the University of Pretoria. Black rhinos from eight of the 11 BRREP sites have already been DNA-profiled and the team is currently undertaking profiling at the other three sites. The indexing system is primarily a rhino identification tool in the crime-fighting and anti-poaching work; however, it also serves as an important resource for genetic material to assist in making informed decisions on rhino population management.</p>
						<p>WWF is working to ensure that the lessons learned through BRREP and other rhino conservation practitioners can be shared more widely. ‘We are also producing a handbook about best-practice rhino management and monitoring approaches in southern Africa, being written by wildlife conservation ecologist Dr Dave Balfour,’ Rusch adds. ‘It covers widely differing rhino regions – from the dry mountainous Kunene region of Namibia to the moist coastal region of KwaZulu-Natal.</p>
						<p>As part of gathering information for the book, a group of experienced rhino reserve managers, conservationists and scientists from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mozambique, Kenya and Zambia met in March 2018 and shared their extensive knowledge.</p>
						<p>The WWF Nedbank Green Trust also recognises the need to partner with communities in conservation and is funding a WWF-SA Wildlife Programme project that is working with three communities adjacent to key wildlife areas in KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo, and on the Mozambique border of the Kruger National Park</p>
						<p>‘The aim is to create positive relationships between people and wildlife conservation, with opportunities for partner communities ranging from supporting governance, finding alternative income-generating opportunities and creating economic growth. This work is being done through the WWF Nedbank Green Trust-funded Rural Initiative for a Sustainable Environment (RISE) Unit at the Southern African Wildlife College,’ explains Nelisiwe Vundla, formerly an honours graduate on the 2015/16 Graduate Development Programme funded by the WWF Nedbank Green Trust, and now Community Development and Learning Lead.</p>
						<p>‘A strong example of the RISE Unit’s work is the project involving the five villages of the Mangalane community that border Sabie Game Park in south-western Mozambique, adjacent to Kruger National Park,’ Vundla explains.</p>
						<p>The Mangalane people are predominantly livestock and maize farmers and over the past three years they have become partners in the anti-poaching drive, as poachers also steal their cattle. And while rhino poaching only benefits a few people, the whole community receives 20% of the revenue from the Sabie Game Park</p>
						<p>‘Residents of Mangalane report any illegal activity to the Sabie Game Park,’ explains Vundla. ‘In addition to the economic and wildlife losses from poaching, the community has firsthand experience of how poaching disrupts their social fabric. Rhino poaching leads to the formation of gangs, and the associated lawlessness.’</p>
						<p>A group of 21 young people has since been appointed to assist with patrolling the fences of the reserve to reduce human-wildlife conflict in situations. Intact fences reduce the risk of a wild animal, such as a lion or elephant, breaking out of the park and destroying livestock or crops. To augment the community’s self-employment income five women-led cooperatives have been established, which include running a small bakery, chicken farming, repurposing of steel for kettles and bathtubs, and goat farming.</p>

						<p>Vundla explains that 15 rhino were recorded as being killed between April 2015 and March 2016 in the Sabie Game Park. This went down to zero poaching between April 2017 and March 2018. ‘It speaks to the success of the partnership with the Mangalane community, and their resistance to poaching. The effect, however, is that it has pushed the poaching north and south of them – so we need to expand the work we are doing in developing relationships between communities and wildlife in a holistic, mutually beneficial circle,’ concludes Vundla.</p>
